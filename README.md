# etch-a-sketch

This project is to show some of the DOM manipulation skills I have. I am building a browser
version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch.

This project is not supposed to be easy for me, at my current skill level,  and I will be doing
a ton of Googling to find the answers that I need.
